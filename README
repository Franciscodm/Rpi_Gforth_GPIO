This is a Gforth library that gives low level access to Raspberry Pi GPIO Header!
The access is done in C via Wrapper functions that are writen in the Gforth library.
The C code is included with a Makefile that creates a shared library. 
The C code it self is mostly from Alanbarr/RaspberryPi-GPIO git repository.
