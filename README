This is a Gforth library that gives low level access to Raspberry Pi GPIO Header!
The access is done in C via Wrapper functions that are writen in the Gforth library.
The C code is included with a Makefile that creates a shared library. 
The C code it self is mostly from Alanbarr/RaspberryPi-GPIO git repository.
##################################################
To use first you need to compile the c code and librarys and install like follows:
	$ cd c_src
	$ sudo make 
	$ sudo make install
Now that you have the c shared library installed do the following
	$ cd ..
	$ sudo gforth
	include rpi_GPIO_lib.fs		# note this line is entered in the gforth program and there is no prompt for this
Now at this moment Gforth has words to do GPIO stuff.  See the code itself for some information oh how to use it!
##################################################
If you change any c code and need to test you will need to clear the gforth library stuff out and recompile the c library.
I have not figured out the proper and best way to do this but here is a way that works.  
After the code change then delete the library and recompile it and install it then run the gforth include command and it should work.
Here are the commands:
	$ cd c_src
	$ sudo make uninstall
	$ sudo make clean
	$ cd ..
	$ sudo gforth
	include rpi_GPIO_lib.fs		# this will cause gforth to clean its librarys out.  Note you will get errors here but this is ok
	bye				# to exit gforth eviroment
	$ cd c_src 
	$ sudo make 
	$ sudo make install
	$ cd ..
	$ sudo gforth
	include rpi_GPIO_lib.fs		# this should be error free and you should be back in business
Sometimes for some reason this does not even work.  You will have noticed a path in the error message in Gforth. As an example the path may have looked like this /root/.gforth/libcc-named/.libs/mygpio.so.0 
This path needs to be removed so do the following.
	$ sudo rm -rf /root/.gforth	# note i do not include anything after the .gforth in this path example
This simply removes the /root/.gforth directory and sub directroys and contents.  Now you need to follow the above first use compile instructions for the library and this should make it  work again!
