This is a Gforth library that gives low level access to Raspberry Pi GPIO Header!
The access is done in C via Wrapper functions that are writen in the Gforth library.
The C code is included with a Makefile that creates a shared library. 
The C code it self is mostly from Alanbarr/RaspberryPi-GPIO git repository.
##################################################
To use first you need to compile the c code and librarys and install like follows:
	$cd c_src
	$sudo make 
	$sudo make install
Now that you have the c shared library installed do the following
	$cd ..
	$sudo gforth
	include rpi_GPIO_lib.fs		# note this line is entered in the gforth program and there is no prompt for this
Now at this moment Gforth has words to do GPIO stuff.  See the code itself for some information oh how to use it!
